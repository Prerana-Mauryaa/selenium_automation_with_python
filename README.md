Several browsers/drivers are supported (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), as well as the Remote protocol.
Supported Python Versions
Python 3.7+

Installing
If you have pip on your system, you can simply install or upgrade the Python bindings:

pip install -U selenium
Alternately, you can download the source distribution from PyPI (e.g. selenium-4.8.0.tar.gz), unarchive it, and run:

python setup.py install
Note: You may want to consider using virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.



Drivers
Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
